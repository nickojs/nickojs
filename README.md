I'm a full-stack developer with **5+ years** of professional experience, focused on **frontend**, building user-friendly, performant, and beautiful web applications.

My current favorite stack:

- React + TypeScript + Redux / Redux Toolkit  (optional, I've been using less and less client state lately)
- Modern styling (Styled-Components, Tailwind, Emotion, etc)  
- Node.js + Express for backend,  NestJS if I'm feeling fancy
- Testing: Jest, React Testing Library, Storybook  
- Websockets, real-time features, clean architecture

And of course, AI powered whenever possible. Either with company-backed premium models or my own peasant personal account. It is simply incredible the speed and quality of projects I can build when using my own pet AI to the side, doing the heavy lifting. 

### Latest personal project


Each tool installs independently and pulls its own dependencies. Core dependencies: tmux, jq, git (optional), age, gocryptfs.
Org: github.com/omni-ecosystem
Docs: omni-cli-docs.vercel.app

**🖥️ Omni CLI** 
Terminal-first workspace manager to organize, monitor, and launch all my projects from one place — supercharged with tmux for smart pane layouts, keybindings, and real-time session control.
What started as me playing around with Claude Code turned into a modular implementation of bash scripts, the [Omni Ecosystem](https://github.com/omni-ecosystem)

[omni-cli](https://github.com/omni-ecosystem/omni-cli): the main workspace manager

[omni-navigator](https://github.com/omni-ecosystem/omni-navigator): file browser and navigation utilities

[omni-secrets](https://github.com/omni-ecosystem/omni-secrets): encrypted secrets management with age + gocryptfs

[omni-ui-kit](https://github.com/omni-ecosystem/omni-ui-kit): shared UI components sourced by other tools


Docs & install guide: [omni-cli-docs.vercel.app](https://omni-cli-docs.vercel.app/)

(Note: This is a very recent change, that doc is outdated already, it only covers the installation of omni-cli. I will updated ASAP!)

###  Pet projecst that are old but I love them

These are older but still pinned because nostalgia + plans to rebuild with modern stack (and play around more with AI-assisted coding).

🔐 **Lockpicking Simulator**: fun front-end recreation of Skyrim's lockpicking mini-game (built right after learning React Hooks).  
  Live (old build, not maintained): [lockpicking-simulator.netlify.app](https://lockpicking-simulator.netlify.app/)  

💬 **Runechat**: websockets-powered chat app (Socket.io), originally planned to tie into OSRS-trade.

🗡️ **OSRS-Trade**: A replica of Old School RuneScape's GE (grand exchange). But here you don't need GPs to trade the items. Go get your GF already! 

I'm probably a bit fan of Runescape... Just a bit. Both Runescape projects are not deployed.
