I'm a full-stack developer with **5+ years** of professional experience, focused on **frontend**, building user-friendly, performant, and beautiful web applications.

My current favorite stack:

- React + TypeScript + Redux / Redux Toolkit  (optional, I've been using less and less client state lately)
- Modern styling (Styled-Components, Tailwind, Emotion, etc)  
- Node.js + Express for backend,  NestJS if I'm feeling fancy
- Testing: Jest, React Testing Library, Storybook  
- Websockets, real-time features, clean architecture

And of course, AI powered whenever possible. Either with company-backed premium models or my own peasant personal account. It is simply incredible the speed and quality of projects I can build when using my own pet AI to the side, doing the heavy lifting. 

### Latest personal project

🖥️ **Omni CLI** 
Terminal-first workspace manager to organize, monitor, and launch all my projects from one place — supercharged with tmux for smart pane layouts, keybindings, and real-time session control. Built in bash, depends on tmux, jq, git (optional), age, gocryptfs.  

This one started as me playing around with Claude Code to get better with AI agents and I ended up building something really useful in a totally different language (bashscript).

Repo: [github.com/nickojs/omni-cli](https://github.com/nickojs/omni-cli)  
Docs & install guide: [omni-cli-docs.vercel.app](https://omni-cli-docs.vercel.app/)

###  Pet projecst that are old but I love them

These are older but still pinned because nostalgia + plans to rebuild with modern stack (and play around more with AI-assisted coding).

🔐 **Lockpicking Simulator** — fun front-end recreation of Skyrim's lockpicking mini-game (built right after learning React Hooks).  
  Live (old build): [lockpicking-simulator.netlify.app](https://lockpicking-simulator.netlify.app/)  

💬 **Runechat** — websockets-powered chat app (Socket.io), originally planned to tie into OSRS-trade. Not deployed.

🗡️ **OSRS-Trade** — Old School RuneScape related project (trading/exchange vibes?). Not deployed.  

(I'm probably a bit fan of Runescape... Just a bit)
